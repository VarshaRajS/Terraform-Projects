This Terraform project defines a foundational infrastructure for a web application deployment on Amazon Web Services (AWS). It effectively leverages Terraform's declarative approach to automate the creation and management of AWS resources, ensuring consistent and reproducible deployments.

**Key Components and Functionality:**

1. **VPC and Subnet:** A virtual private cloud (VPC) is established to isolate the application's resources from the public internet, enhancing security. A public subnet within this VPC allows the application to communicate with the internet.
2. **Key Pair**: An SSH key pair is generated, enabling secure remote access to the deployed EC2 instance.
3. **Security Group:** A security group is configured to control inbound and outbound traffic to the EC2 instance, implementing necessary security measures.
4. **Internet Gateway and Route Table:** An internet gateway is created to connect the VPC to the internet, and a route table is associated with the public subnet to direct internet traffic.
5. **EC2 Instance:** An EC2 instance is launched in the public subnet, serving as the application's host. It is configured with the specified AMI, instance type, key pair, and security group.
6. **Provisioning:** Provisioners are utilized to:
* Copy the application code ("app.py") to the EC2 instance.
* Install necessary dependencies like Python 3 and Flask.
* Start the application in the background.
